* Hi there, I'm yahia, a Software developer engineer (Full-stack web developer) for 5ys, and a Hardware engineer (Embedded systems) for 2ys.
* I have many skills related to both themes you can see them on my LinkedIn account page.

------------------------------------- Web Dev -------------------------------------------
* I've done a lot of web projects like CRUDS system management, and weather app linked with API, and landing pages, (alongside a great and fully responsive design of course).
* I've decent experience in working on a lot of dev software like vscode and xamp, alongside with design software too like Figma and Adobe Photoshop & after Effects...
* I've some experience in a lot of programming languages related to both fields like Javascript, PHP, c, c++, assembly, kotlin, java, python, Ruby ...
* I've some experience in front-end web dev frameworks like vue(JS), and for back-end like Laravel(PHP).
* I'm very aware of the most used programming techniques and technologies like OOP, DOM, AJAX, JSON data, and APIs. with experience in dealing with web server requests and responses ...
* I've knowledge of web hosts and Data Structure and databases like MySQL, NoSQL, MongoDB... 
** I've worked on android projects too i've some experience in android dev, like multi-cross platforms (flutter), kotlin, java, Android Studio...

-------------------------------Embedded Systems Dev---------------------------------
* I know a lot about electronic engineering, like microcontroller programming, PCB designs, and more. and several software that are commonly used in that field. (I've built several projects).
* I've some experience working with circuit design softwares Like Matlab, Proteus, Tinkercad, and EAGLE ...
* I know programming langs related to this field like C, C++, ASSEMBLY...
* I've some experience in microcontrollers programming like PIC family, and ATMEGA ...
* I've done many mini-projects with Arduino UNO and ESP32 boards. 

--------------------------------- Other Interests Fields ------------------------------------
* I've some knowledge of computer science generally. like:
- CPU's different architectures (ARM + x86) and how they work differently in executing the Assembly instructions.
- CPU registers and how they work with RAM asynchronously.
- CPU programming in different programming langs like Assembly and C, C++.
* I've knowledge of Reverse Engineering and ethical hacking:
- I've worked a lot with a lot reversing necessary tools like Debuggers, Interpreters, and Disassemblers, like Ghidra, IDA pro, Ninga binary, Jax core, and more ...
- I've used my exp in a lot of reversing challenges in many different types of reversing like Unix-system ELF files (windows + Linux), binary files, dump files, and firmware codes and I know more about common gaps like Buffer Overflow, Memory leaks and more ... I've done this challenges in many websites like CTFLearn and PicoCTF (The link is in the experience section below)...
- I'm not a pro but I know a lot about cyber security and ethical hacking and I've worked with a lot tools of in those fields in different Operating systems like Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Fedora, Arch Linux ...
Most used tools that I've worked in:
- Networking: Wifite, Fluxion, Eviltwin Attack, Aircrack-nj, Nmap, Wireshark...
- Operating Systems Exploits: Metasploit framework,  Social Engineering Toolkit, BEef ...
- Web Hacking & security: Burp suite ...
- Brute-force & password attacks: Hydra, Hashcat, John the ripper ...
- Apk exploitations: ApkTool ...
- OSINT: Maltego ...

--------------------------------- Academically ------------------------------------
* I have a Master's degree in Electromechanical Engineering.
* I've knowledge in this field: 
- Matlab, Simulink, Electric Motors & pumps, Electrical Controls, Electrical Machines, Electromechanics, Electro-mechanical Troubleshooting, automatics, power electronics, Microprocessors and APIs, electrical networks, servo systems, hydraulic and pneumatic systems ...

---------------------------------- END ---------------------------------
* At the end I'm (web developer, Embedded systems Developer, Software & hardware developer, Cyber security and ethical hacking amateur, and reverse engineer ) At the same time üòé üéìüßë‚Äçüéì.
